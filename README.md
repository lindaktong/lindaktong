💻  I'm an undergrad at Stanford studying Computer Science and Classics.

👩🏻‍  I'm passionate about making education more accessible to learners around the world, especially in CS. I taught coding to middle school girls at Jay Pritzker Academy in Cambodia, worked at education companies in Vietnam and China, and I was a head TA for [Code in Place](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/), an online offering of Stanford's introductory CS class with over 22,000 students. I also [teach Python at Stanford](https://cs198.stanford.edu/cs198/Alumni.aspx).
