💻  I'm an undergrad at Stanford studying Computer Science. I'm interested in leveraging technology for social impact, especially in the fields of AI ethics, civic tech, and education.

👩🏻‍  I'm passionate about increasing the pipeline of women entering STEM. In high school, I led my school's Girls Who Code chapter, and for the past three years, I have been involved with the #BUILTBYGIRLS Wave mentorship program, which has paired me with software engineers, data scientists, and PMs at Uber, Squarespace, and Handy. This past winter, I helped organize Techtogther 2020, Boston's largest all-female hackathon and served as a student ambassador for Harvard's WeCode (Women Engineers Code) Conference.
