💻  I'm an undergrad at Stanford studying Computer Science. I'm interested in leveraging technology for social impact, especially in the fields of AI ethics, civic tech, and education.

👩🏻‍  I'm passionate about increasing the pipeline of women entering STEM. This past year, I taught coding to middle school girls at Jay Pritzker Academy in Cambodia, helped organize Techtogther 2020, Boston's largest all-female hackathon and served as a student ambassador for Harvard's WeCode (Women Engineers Code) Conference.
